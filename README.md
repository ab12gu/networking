Serial Buses

Serial communication
- sending data one bit at a time, sequentiallly
- Improved signal integrity and transmission speeds in short distances have outweighted parallel buses
- Modern example: PCIe, sned data several bits at a time via modulation/encoding
- Long distance generally sticks to serial over parallel to reduce cost of cable
- Examples:
  - PS/2 port: 6-pin mini-DIN connector used for connecting keyboards and mice to a PC
  - USB: universal serial bus
